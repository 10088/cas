# RC5 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting
for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA`
is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS
releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on
specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in
a particular release, we recommended that you start early by
experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we
invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your
deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings
attached. Having the financial means to better sustain engineering activities will allow
the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term
support, maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing
critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will ensure support for
the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and
the CAS project at that, runs and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to
be a critical part of the identity and access management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of the [CAS WAR Overlay](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Installation.html), 
adjust the following setting:

```properties
cas.version=6.5.0-RC5
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the 
minimum system/platform requirements for this release.
</div>

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.
 
### Spring Cloud Kubernetes

Support for [Spring Cloud Kubernetes](../configuration/Configuration-Server-Management-SpringCloud-Kubernetes.html), 
particularly when it comes to configuration management via `ConfigMap`
or `Secret` concepts in Kubernetes is now *baked* into CAS.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end browser tests based on Puppeteer continue to grow
to add additional scenarios. At this point, there are
approximately `230` test scenarios and we'll continue to add more in the coming releases.
   
### OpenID Connect JMeter Script
   
A new [JMeter test script](../high_availability/Performance-Testing-JMeter.html) is now 
available to support running load tests for a CAS server acting as an OpenID Connect provider.

### OpenID Connect JSON Web Keystore

The JSON web keystore that is generated by CAS to handle crypto 
operations for [OpenID Connect](../authentication/OIDC-Authentication-JWKS.html) is now able to generate 
key pairs for signing and encryption via the `use` attribute in the generated JWKS. The presence of 
this attribute is optional and CAS, on a best-effort basis, may fall back to using keys without a specified `use` flag.

### CAS Initializer Configuration Metadata

The collection of reference configuration properties produced by the [CAS Initializr](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html)
are now removed and the functionality is now moved to the produced overlay itself using dedicated Gradle tasks. This is done so
that the collection of properties, produced based on CAS configuration metadata, accurately reflect the CAS version used by
the overlay itself, and not one that is statically compiled and made available to the CAS Initializer itself. 

## Other Stuff

- Validation of configuration properties is now moved into a proper `ApplicationContextInitializer` component.
- Minor improvements to the construction of SAML2 authentication requests sent to [an external identity provider](../integration/Delegate-Authentication-SAML.html), when CAS itself is acting as a SAML2 identity provider.
